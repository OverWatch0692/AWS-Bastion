Windows Event Forwarding (WEF) allows for the centralized collection of event logs from multiple Windows servers, facilitating streamlined monitoring and security analysis. In our AWS environment, we configured WEF to forward event logs from source servers to a designated Event Collector server.

2. Prerequisites

Active Directory (AD) Domain: All participating servers must be part of the same AD domain.

Windows Remote Management (WinRM): Ensure WinRM is enabled on all source and collector servers.

3. Steps Undertaken

a. Configure the Event Collector Server

Enable WinRM: On the Event Collector server, execute:

powershell
Copy
Edit
  winrm quickconfig
This command sets up the WinRM service and configures the necessary firewall exceptions.

Enable Windows Event Collector Service: Run:

powershell
Copy
Edit
  wecutil qc
This initializes the Event Collector service to receive events.

b. Configure Source Computers

Enable WinRM: On each source computer, execute:

powershell
Copy
Edit
  winrm quickconfig
Add Event Collector to Event Log Readers Group: On each source computer, add the Event Collector's computer account to the Event Log Readers group to grant necessary permissions.
c. Create and Deploy Group Policy Object (GPO)

Open Group Policy Management Console (GPMC): On a Domain Controller or a system with GPMC installed.

Create a New GPO: Right-click on the desired Organizational Unit (OU) and select Create a GPO in this domain, and Link it here...

Configure Subscription Manager:

Navigate to:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
Computer Configuration → Policies → Administrative Templates → Windows Components → Event Forwarding → Configure target Subscription Manager
Enable the policy and set the server address:

arduino
Copy
Edit
Server=http://<EventCollector_FQDN>:5985/wsman/SubscriptionManager/WEC,Refresh=60
Replace <EventCollector_FQDN> with the Fully Qualified Domain Name of the Event Collector server.

Configure Log Access:

Navigate to:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
Computer Configuration → Policies → Administrative Templates → Windows Components → Event Log Service → Security → Configure log access
Set the appropriate Security Descriptor Definition Language (SDDL) to grant the Event Collector access to the Security event log.

Link GPO to Source Computers: Ensure the GPO is linked to the OU containing the source computers.

d. Configure Event Subscriptions on Event Collector

Open Event Viewer: On the Event Collector server.

Create a New Subscription:

Right-click on Subscriptions and select Create Subscription.

Define the subscription criteria, such as the events to collect and the source computers.

e. Verify Functionality

Force GPO Update: On source computers, run:

powershell
Copy
Edit
  gpupdate /force
Check Event Forwarding Status: On the Event Collector server, verify that events from source computers are being received in the Forwarded Events log.
